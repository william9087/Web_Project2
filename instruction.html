        Welcome to Hangman ! Your challenge is to guess the hidden word or
        phrase by suggesting letters. Simply select a letter, and if it's part
        of the word, it will be revealed; if not, a part of the hangman figure
        will appear. Keep guessing until you've guessed the word correctly or
        made too many incorrect guesses. Have fun testing your vocabulary and
        deduction skills!
